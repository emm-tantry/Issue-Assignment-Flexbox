          <p>In my case, it started as verbal abuse. I’d known my partner for 20 years and he was a good person. He started changing in 2015. After his mum died, he bought several guns including a machete and a shotgun. He became more combative. I couldn’t do anything right. One evening in early November it turned physical. We were having a conversation and at some point it escalated and I asked him to leave. I walked over to the door, opened it and said we could have the conversation another day. He grabbed me by the hood of my sweatshirt, threw me out my door and got on top of me and started choking me. I managed to yell for our oldest son and he got off of me and left.</p>

          <p>I’m slowly learning that I’m safe again. Each time my boyfriend gets annoyed at little things and doesn’t take his frustration out on me, I relax a little bit. Even though my mind has always known that my boyfriend is nothing like my ex, my body is also slowly learning to trust. And each time he does something that inadvertently triggers me, like back me into a corner or pin me down after a particularly enthusiastic tickle fight, he apologizes and learns from it. He’ll either give me space if I don’t want to be touched in that moment, or hold me until my heart rate slows down to normal. My whole life is different now. I’m no longer spending every waking moment appeasing someone else for fear of their mood swings.</p>
